# Planetary Classification

Created an enumeration "Planets of the Solar System" containing all the planets.

Defined fields within the enumeration include the planet's name and a constructor that accepts the planet's name.

## Task

Implemented a method in the `Main` class that displays the planet's type: Rocky, Habitable, Gas Giant, or Ice Planet. In the `main` method, the user is prompted to select a planet, and in response, the classification of that planet is displayed using the developed method.

Note: Pluto is not considered a planet as it resides in the Kuiper Belt, where larger planetoids have been discovered.

## Additional Task

Added fields for "radius" and "mass" in the enumeration. Information about the radius and mass is displayed after classification.

## Extra Mile

Added a method to the enumeration that calculates the acceleration due to gravity (`g`) for the planet using the formula `Gm/r^2`, where `m` is the mass, `r` is the radius, and `G` is the gravitational constant, which is 6.6743e-11. Information about mass, radius, and calculated acceleration due to gravity (`g`) is displayed.

Reference: `g` - acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, it averages around 9.8 meters per second squared.

### Usage Example


### Note

Use the corresponding number of each planet according to their order in the enumeration.
